I have been trying to link Tomcat with Eclipse to test my SOAP client and intermediary, 
but despite multiple attempts, I have not been able to get it to work. I have checked 
the server settings, deployment paths, and logs, and I have followed various troubleshooting 
steps, but the issue persists.

I have spent a significant amount of time trying to resolve this, testing different configurations
 and solutions, but I still cannot properly connect Tomcat with Eclipse. As a result, I have been
 unable to verify the functionality of my project.

Given these difficulties, I would like to request the opportunity to correct the issue and finalize
 my project this week. I appreciate your understanding and any guidance you can provide.
