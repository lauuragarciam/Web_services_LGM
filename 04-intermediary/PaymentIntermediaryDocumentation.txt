SOAP Intermediary Documentation â€“ PaymentIntermediaryServlet

This servlet implements a SOAP intermediary for the `processPayment` operation of my PayService web service deployed at http://127.0.0.1:8002/PayService. It processes incoming SOAP requests, modifies them based on a custom header, and returns a modified SOAP response.

Workflow Description:

1. Receiving Request from Client (SoapUI):
   - The servlet accepts incoming POST requests containing a SOAP message.
   - It extracts the original message using MessageFactory and reads the input stream.

2. Processing the Custom Header (<discount>):
   - The SOAP header is checked for a custom element:
     <discount value="0.15" xmlns="http://tweaks.com/"/>
   - If found, the value attribute is parsed as a decimal discount factor (e.g., 0.15 for 15%).

3. Modifying the SOAP Body (Applying the Discount):
   - The SOAP body is examined for the processPayment operation.
   - Inside the operation, it locates the amount parameter (arg1).
   - The amount is multiplied by (1 - discountFactor) to apply the discount.
   - For example, if the original amount was 100 and the discount was 0.15, it becomes 85.0.

4. Forwarding the Modified Request to the Real Service:
   - The modified message is sent to the original web service (http://127.0.0.1:8002/PayService) using SOAPConnection.

5. Adding a Response Header:
   - A new header is inserted into the response before sending it back to the client:
     <discountApplied xmlns="http://tweaks.com/">15% discount applied</discountApplied>
   - This confirms to the client that a discount was processed and shows the percentage.

6. Returning the Response to the Client:
   - The final SOAP message (including the original service response + custom header) is written to the HTTP response and sent back to the client.


Example:

Input: 

<soapenv:Envelope xmlns:soapenv="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/" xmlns:pay="http://payService/">
   <soapenv:Header>
      <discount value="0.15" xmlns="http://tweaks.com/"/>
   </soapenv:Header>
   <soapenv:Body>
      <pay:processPayment>
         <!--Optional:-->
         <arg0>Alice</arg0>
         <arg1>20</arg1>
      </pay:processPayment>
   </soapenv:Body>
</soapenv:Envelope>


Response:

<S:Envelope xmlns:S="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/">
   <S:Header>
      <discountApplied xmlns="http://tweaks.com/">15% discount applied</discountApplied>
   </S:Header>
   <S:Body>
      <ns2:processPaymentResponse xmlns:ns2="http://payService/">
         <return>Payment successful. Alice paid $17.0. Remaining balance: $33.0</return>
      </ns2:processPaymentResponse>
   </S:Body>
</S:Envelope>
